# Resource: azuread_directory_role

Manages a Directory Role within Azure Active Directory. Directory Roles are also known as Administrator Roles.

Directory Roles are built-in to Azure Active Directory and are immutable. However, by default they are not activated in a tenant (except for the Global Administrator role). This resource ensures a directory role is activated from its associated role template, and exports the object ID of the role, so that role assignments can be made for it.

Once activated, directory roles cannot be deactivated and so this resource does not perform any actions on destroy.

## API Permissions

The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Privileged Role Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
